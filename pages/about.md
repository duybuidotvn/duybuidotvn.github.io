I am freelancer developer. I had more than 5 years of experiences in software design and development for one of the largest IT and professional services in the world. Besides that, I have worked as a lecturer and research assistant in more than two years at Pham Van Dong University. My teaching courses were Computer Concepts, Basic Programming, Algorithms and Data Structures, Discrete Maths. My researches mainly focused on Programming Techniques, Advanced Algorithms, and Web Application Development. My languages programming were C/C++, Java, JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, and using GitHub for code management. I am familiar with markup language to write my technical reports and research paper.
